      * d/control: convert mysql-client back to a meta-package as well.

        work on mysql 5.5, so adding Breaks: for client and server 5.1.

        some of these files are included internally by others in the 
        main dir.

    Gerasiov). Closes: #515145

    It now passes 100% of the tests again. Also Closes: #533999
  * Preinst now prevents Installation if NDB configuration is detected.
  * Applied Ubuntu patch that fixes privilege bootstrapping in postinst
    (thanks to Mathias Gug). Closes: #535492
  * Applied Ubuntu patch that sets the debconf prio for the root password
    question to high and prevents it from being asked on 5.0 -> 5.1 upgrades
    (thanks to Mathias Gug). Closes: #535500
  * Removed the check for ISAM tables as the only supported upgrade path is
    from lenny's MySQL-5.0.
  * Added /etc/mysql/conf.d/mysqld_safe_syslog.cnf which enables mysqld_safe
    to pipe all mysqld output into the syslog. The reason for not letting dpkg
    handle it via a normal config file change was that my.cnf is usually
    heavily tuned by the admin so the setting would go lost too easily.
  * Updated mysqlreport to version 3.5 (including two minor patches by me).

mysql-dfsg-5.1 (5.1.16beta-4) experimental; urgency=high

  * Merged with 5.0 r850:
    * SECURITY:
      In some previous versions mysql_install_db was not idempotent and did
      always create passwordless root accounts although it should only on
      initial installs (thanks to Olaf van der Spek). Closes: #418672
    * Added check for passwordless root accounts to debian-start.
    * As MySQL-5.0 is, at least currently, incompatible with Kernel 2.4 the
      installation is aborted for such old kernels. Debian Etch does not
      support them anyway according to the release notes but this might be 
      unexpected and many production servers still have self build ones 
      installed (thanks to Marc-Christian Petersen). See: #416841
    * Adjusted TeX build-deps to texlive.
    * Added innotop. 
    * Changed maintainer email address to
      pkg-mysql-commits@lists.alioth.debian.org

mysql-dfsg-5.1 (5.1.16beta-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merged with 5.0 r837:
    * Activated the blackhole engine as it's needed for replicating partition
      designs (thanks to Cyril SCETBON). 
    * Fixed segfault on i486 systems without cpuid instruction (thanks to
      Lennart Sorensen). Closes: #410474
    * Only use of the non-essential debconf package in postrm if it is
      still installed (thanks to Michael Ablassmeier). Closes: #416838

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Mar 2007 21:48:11 +0100

mysql-dfsg-5.1 (5.1.16beta-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Merged with 5.0 r818:
    * Fixed FTBFS on Sparc introduced with the "make -j" trick in
      5.0.32-8 (thanks to Frank Lichtenheld). Closes: #415026

 -- Christian Hammers <ch@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Mar 2007 21:20:11 +0100

mysql-dfsg-5.1 (5.1.16beta-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
    * SECURITY: Using an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table with ORDER BY in a subquery
      could cause a server crash (CVE-2007-1420).
    * Added temporary patch 90_TEMP_sqlparse-ifdef to avoid build problems.
  * Merged with 5.0 r809:
    * Updated mysqlreport to latest upstream (and patched --help usage
      message and "return if qcache_size==0").
  * Merged with 5.0 r798:
    * Adapt MAKE_J to use the -j option with the number of available
      processors. (thanks to Raphael Pinson).
  * Merged with 5.0 r758:
    * Changed minimum required version in dh_makeshlibs to 5.0.27-1 as
      5.0.26 had an ABI breakage in it!
      This is the cause for Perl programs crashing with the following error: 
      Transactions not supported by database at /usr/lib/perl5/DBI.pm line 672
    * Added some more comments to the default my.cnf.
    * Added support for /etc/mysql/conf.d/.
    * The debian-start script that runs on every server start now first upgrades
      the system tables (if neccessary) and then check them as it sometimes did
      not work the other way around (e.g. for MediaWiki). The script now uses 
      mysql_update instead of mysql_update_script as recommended. See: 409780

  * Fix debian-start.inc.sh for table names with characters needing quotes.
    Thanks Felix Rublack! (closes: #480525, #481154, #481303, #484012)

  * Remove build of ndb docs, since they are not installed. Removed build deps
    on TeX and doxygen since that's all they were there for.
  * Replace script in check_for_crashed_tables with a myisam-recover option
    and a script to trigger a check of those tables. (thanks HarrisonF and
    kolbe)
  * Replace direct calls to test suite with calls to the make targets used by
    the MySQL build and qa teams for releases.
  * Add --skip-ndbcluster to the postinst bootstrap command. It's really a
    workaround for a bug in 5.1, but it's probably a good idea anyway since we
    certainly don't need cluster to spin up, and if people have enabled
    cluster in their my.cnf file, there could be postinst issues if cluster
    isn't running.

mysql-dfsg-5.0 (5.0.27-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (but no codechange, the only difference to 5.0.26
    was a patch to the ABI change which Debian already included.
  * When dist-upgrading from mysql-server-4.1/sarge dpkg does not longer
    ask unnecessary "config file has changed" questions regarding
    /etc/init.d/mysql, /etc/logrotate.d/mysql-server and
    /etc/mysql/debian-start just because these files previously belonged
    to mysql-server-4.1 and not to mysql-server-5.0.
    To archive this mysql-server-5.0 now pre-depends on mysql-common which

mysql-dfsg-5.0 (5.0.26-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * SECURITY: 
    This combined release of 5.0.25 and 5.0.26 fixes lot of possible server
    crashs so it should get into Etch. Quoting the changelog (bug numbers are
    bugs.mysql.com ones):
    - character_set_results can be NULL to signify no conversion, but some
      code did not check for NULL, resulting in a server crash. (Bug#21913)
    - Using cursors with READ COMMITTED isolation level could cause InnoDB to
      crash. (Bug#19834)
    - Some prepared statements caused a server crash when executed a second
      time. (Bug#21166)
    - When DROP DATABASE or SHOW OPEN TABLES was issued while concurrently 
      issuing DROP TABLE (or RENAME TABLE, CREATE TABLE LIKE or any other 
      statement that required a name lock) in another connection, the server 
      crashed. (Bug#21216)
    - Use of zero-length variable names caused a server crash. (Bug#20908)
    - For InnoDB tables, the server could crash when executing NOT IN () 
      subqueries. (Bug#21077) 
    - Repeated DROP TABLE statements in a stored procedure could sometimes
      cause the server to crash. (Bug#19399)
    - Performing an INSERT on a view that was defined using a SELECT that 
      specified a collation and a column alias caused the server to crash 
      (Bug#21086).
    - A query of the form shown here caused the server to crash. (Bug#21007)
    - NDB Cluster: Some queries involving joins on very large NDB tables could
      crash the MySQL server. (Bug#21059)
    - The character set was not being properly initialized for CAST() with a
      type like CHAR(2) BINARY, which resulted in incorrect results or even a 
      server crash. (Bug#17903)
    - For certain queries, the server incorrectly resolved a reference to an
      aggregate function and crashed. (Bug#20868)
    - The server crashed when using the range access method to execut a
      subquery with a ORDER BY DESC  clause. (Bug#20869)
    - Triggers on tables in the mysql database caused a server crash. Triggers
      for tables in this database now are disallowed. (Bug#18361)
    - Using SELECT on a corrupt MyISAM table using the dynamic record format 
      could cause a server crash. (Bug#19835) 
    - Use of MIN() or MAX()  with GROUP BY on a ucs2  column could cause a
      server crash. (Bug#20076)
    - Selecting from a MERGE table could result in a server crash if the
      underlying tables had fewer indexes than the MERGE table itself. 
      (Bug#21617, Bug#22937)

  * New upstream release.
    - This bug would cause trouble for Sarge->Etch upgrades, it was supposed to
      have been fixed in 5.0.16 but that apparently did not fix the whole
      problem:
      Using tables from MySQL 4.x in MySQL 5.x, in particular those with VARCHAR
      fields and using INSERT DELAYED to update data in the table would result in
      either data corruption or a server crash. (Bug#16611, Bug#16218, Bug#17294) 
      Closes: #386337
    - Fixes data corruption as an automatic client reconnect used to set
      the wrong character set. Closes: #365050
    - Fixes an undefined ulong type in an include file. Closes: #389102
    - Fixes wrong output format when using Unicode characters. Closes: #355302
    - Fixes mysql_upgrade when using a password. Closes: #371841

  * Added thread_cache_size=8 to default my.cnf as this variable seems to have
    a negligible memory footprint but can improve performance when lots of
    threads connect simultaneously as often seen on web servers.

    was found to be really cool :)
  * Moved tempdir from /tmp to /var/tmp as it will more likely have enough
    free space as /tmp is often on the root partition and /var or at least

      permissions of this user and then those of a password having one.

mysql-dfsg-4.1 (4.1.9-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * SECURITY:
    For historical reasons /usr/share/mysql/ was owned and writable by
    the user "mysql". This is a security problem as some scripts that
    are run by root are in this directory and could be modified and used
    by a malicious user who already has mysql privileges to gain full root
    rights (thanks to Matt Brubeck). Closes: #293345
  * Changed "skip-networking" to "bind-address 127.0.0.1" which is more
    compatible and not less secure but maybe even more, as less people enable
    networking for all interfaces (thanks to Arjen Lentz).
  * Enabled InnoDB by default as recommended by Arjen Lentz from MySQL.

    After a short discussion with MySQL, I decided to drop OpenSSL support as
    1. MySQL started shipping their binaries without it, too and do not
       seem to support it in favour of using a different library somewhen.
    2. MySQL did not adjust their licence to grant permission to link
       against OpenSSL.
    3. Even if they did, third parties who use libmysqlclient.so often
       do not realise licencing problems or even do not want OpenSSL.

  * SECURITY:
    This upstream version fixes some security problems that might at least
    allow a DoS attack on the server.
    * Fixed an old bug in concurrent accesses to `MERGE' tables (even
      one `MERGE' table and `MyISAM' tables), that could've resulted in
      a crash or hang of the server. (Bug #2408)
    * Fixed bug in privilege checking where, under some conditions, one
      was able to grant privileges on the database, he has no privileges
      on. (Bug #3933)
    * Fixed crash in `MATCH ... AGAINST()' on a phrase search operator
      with a missing closing double quote. (Bug #3870)

      required a compromised DNS server and certain operating systems).

    false-positive is reported in the case that immediately after starting
    the server a client starts using a table (thanks to Uwe Kappe).
    Closes: #269985
  * Added "quote-names" as default to the [mysqldump] section in
    /etc/mysql/my.cnf as too many users stumble over dump files that
    could not be read in again due to the valid use of reserved words
    as table names. This has also be done by upstream in 4.1.1 and has
    no known drawbacks. Closes: #269865
  * Binary logs can now be rotated as well. Defaults to off, though, for
    compatibilty reasons (thanks to Mark Ferlatte). Closes: #94230, #269110
  * The mysql user "debian-sys-maint" now gets all possible rights which
    makes binary logging possible and helps other package maintainer who
    wants to use it to create package specific databases and users.
  * Added example how to change daemon nice level via /etc/mysql/my.cnf
  * Updated French debconf translations (thanks to Christian Perrier).

  * Renamed options in the default config file that still had old names

  * SECURITY
    This version fixes a security flaw in mysqlhotcopy which created
    temporary files in /tmp which had predictable filenames and such
    could be used for a tempfile run attack.
    The issue has been recorded as CAN-2004-0457.

mysql-dfsg (4.0.20-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * MySQL finally updated their copyright page and installed v1.5 of
    the "Free/Libre and Open Source Software License (FLOSS) - Exception"
    which will hopefully end the license hell they created by putting the
    client libraries under GPL instead of LGPL which conflicts with PHP and
    other software that used to link against MySQL.
    The license text is not yet in any release MySQL version but visible
    on their web site and copied into the debian/copyright file.
    Special thanks to Zak Greant <zak@mysql.com> and the debian-legal list
    for helping to solve this release critical problem.
    Closes: #242449
  * Updated Brazil debconf translation (thanks to Andre Luis Lopes).
    Closes: #264233
  * Updated Japanese debconf translation (thanks to Hideki Yamane).
    Closes: #264620
  * Fixed minor typo in debconf description (thanks to TROJETTE Mohammed
    Adnene). Closes: #264840

    do no longer communicate but are present in the process list (thanks to
    Henrik Johansson). Closes: #263215

mysql-dfsg (4.0.20-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Partly reverted the last patch which gave the mysql-user
    "debian-sys-maint" more rights as there are old versions of MySQL which
    have fewer privlige columns. Now only those are set (thanks to Alan Tam).
    Closes: #263111

mysql-dfsg (4.0.20-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The mysqlcheck that is started from the initscript will now be
    backgrounded because it might else prevent the boot process to continue.
    It also now notifies root by mail and syslog if a table is corrupt.
  * The "debian-sys-maint" MySQL user now has almost full rights so that other
    packages might use this account to create databases and user (thanks to
    Andreas Barth). Closes: #262541
  * Added paranoid rules for logcheck.

mysql-dfsg (4.0.20-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Solved the upstream bug that error messages of the server are written
    in a file that is then rotated away leaving mysqld logging effectively
    to /dev/null. It now logs to a /usr/bin/logger process which puts the
    messages into the syslog.
    Modified files: /etc/init.d/mysql, /usr/bin/mysqld_safe and the 
    logchecker files. Closes: #254070
  * The initscript does no longer call mysqlcheck directly but via
    /etc/mysql/debian-start which is a user customizable config script.
  * Splitted the debconf "install and update notes" and only show them
    when it is appropriate (thanks to Steve Langasek). Closes: #240515
  * Added NEWS.Debian.
  * Added hint to -DBIG_ROWS, which is currently not used, to README.Debian.

  * Moved the debconf question whether to remove the databases or not
    from mysql-server.config to mysql-server.postrm so that it shows
    up on purge time and not months earlier (thanks to Wouter Verhelst).
    Closes: #251838

    running. Feedback appreciated!
  * Made postinst script more robust by calling db_stop earlier and
    so prevent pipe-deadlocks.
  * Fixed minor typos in initscript (thanks to "C.Y.M."). Closes: 259518
  * Added the undocumented "-DBIG_JOINS" that MySQL apparently uses in
    their MAX binaries. It enables 62 instead of 30 tables in a "join".
    (thanks to Dave Rolsky). Closes: #260843

mysql-dfsg (3.23.51-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected copyright file: the MySQL client library is licenced under
    the LGPL-2 not the GPL. From version 4.x it actually will be GPL this

mysql-dfsg (3.23.51-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
  * I applied a patch that fixes a binary imcompatibility in
    the shared libary libmysqlclient.so.10 between 3.23.50 and
    some versions earlier. Upstream has been contacted and asked
    for clarification. Closes: #149952
  * Added support for NIS i.e. it shows a warning and fails if the
    needed 'mysql' user does not exists but works if it does.
    Closes: #143282, #147869
  * Substituted $0 in init scripts by something really weird so that
    "./S20mysql restart" works now, too. (BTW: S20? install file-rc!!!)
    Closes: #148658
  * Now postinst works even if /etc/init.d/mysql is removed. Closes: #151021

    Fixes a very annoying and important bug that lets all mysql programs
    including perl scripts etc. segfault when using the read_default_group()
    function. 3.23.50 is currently a pre-release and expected to be released
    next week. I plan to propose it for woody as soon as its stability has
    been proven. The following bug reports are all regarding this issue.
    Closes: #144960, #145322, #136798, #138143,

mysql-dfsg (3.23.49x-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had to split the package to seperate the manual as it is not GPL
    like the rest of the software and docs but under a license that
    e.g. forbids selling printed versions. 
    .
    The upstream authors were contacted a while ago but did not like to
    change the situation.
    .
    The names of the resulting packages have not changed as the manual
    already was in a seperate mysql-doc package due to it's size. 
    The source packages are now splitted from one "mysql" to 
    "mysql-dfsg" in main and "mysql-nonfree" in non-free.
  * No code change! 
    The "x" at the end of the version number ist just to be able to 
    upload a new source package. ("a" was already taken by upstream 
    for their binary upload correction)

  * Recreating debian-sys-main pwd on every install to help people who
    accidently delete user or password files...

    owned by root.

  * Finally removed debconf toggled "skip-networking" line add/remove 
    code for /etc/mysql/my.cnf. I don't like editing a file that's tagged

  * SECURITY FIX: One could place database tables outside the database
    directory by using '..' in one of the mysql helper programs where the
