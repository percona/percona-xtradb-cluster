# A wsrep-enabled MySQL server daemon needs a special option if it is to start
# as the first node of a Galera cluster.
# With SystemV init, this could be passed as a "bootstrap" (rather than "start") command:
#     sudo service mysqld bootstrap
#
# With systemd, such alternative commands are not possible.
# However, systemd passes a set of environment variables to the service process
# it starts, and this set can be modified.
# Such a modification would be persistent, so it must be undone after use.
#
# If other options are set already, make sure to use them, and to restore them.
