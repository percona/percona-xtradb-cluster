   ACID

     Set of properties that guarantee database transactions are 
     processed reliably. Stands for :term:`Atomicity`,
     :term:`Consistency`, :term:`Isolation`, :term:`Durability`.
  
   Atomicity

     Atomicity means that database operations are applied following a
     "all or nothing" rule. A transaction is either fully applied or not
     at all.
  
   Consistency

     Consistency means that each transaction that modifies the database
     takes it from one consistent state to another.
  
   Durability

     Once a transaction is committed, it will remain so.
  
   Foreign Key

     A referential constraint between two tables. Example: A purchase
     order in the purchase_orders table must have been made by a customer
     that exists in the customers table.
  
   Isolation

     The Isolation requirement means that no transaction can interfere
     with another.
  
   InnoDB A

     :term:`Storage Engine` for MySQL and derivatives
     (:term:`Percona Server`, :term:`MariaDB`) originally written by
     Innobase Oy, since acquired by Oracle. It provides :term:`ACID`
     compliant storage engine with :term:`foreign key` support. InnoDB
     is the default storage engine on all platforms.
  
   Jenkins

     `Jenkins <http://www.jenkins-ci.org>`_ is a continuous integration
     system that we use to help ensure the continued quality of the
     software we produce. It helps us achieve the aims of:
  
      * no failed tests in trunk on any platform,
      * aid developers in ensuring merge requests build and test on all platforms,
      * no known performance regressions (without a damn good explanation).
  
   LSN

     Log Serial Number. A term used in relation to the :term:`InnoDB` or
     :term:`XtraDB` storage engines.
  
   MariaDB

     A fork of :term:`MySQL` that is maintained primarily by Monty
     Program AB. It aims to add features, fix bugs while maintaining 100%
     backwards compatibility with MySQL.
  
   MyISAM

     A :term:`MySQL` :term:`Storage Engine` that was the default until
     MySQL 5.5.
  
   MySQL

     An open source database that has spawned several distributions and
     forks. MySQL AB was the primary maintainer and distributor until
     bought by Sun Microsystems, which was then acquired by Oracle. As
     Oracle owns the MySQL trademark, the term MySQL is often used for
     the Oracle distribution of MySQL as distinct from the drop-in
     replacements such as :term:`MariaDB` and :term:`Percona Server`.
  
   NUMA

     Non-Uniform Memory Access 
     (`NUMA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access>`_) is a
     computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access
     time depends on the memory location relative to a processor. Under NUMA,
     a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory,
     that is, memory local to another processor or memory shared between
     processors. The whole system may still operate as one unit, and all memory
     is basically accessible from everywhere, but at a potentially higher latency
     and lower performance.
  
   Percona Server for MySQL

     Percona's branch of :term:`MySQL` with performance and management improvements.
  
   Percona Server

     See :term:`Percona Server for MySQL`
  
   Storage Engine

     A :term:`Storage Engine` is a piece of software that implements the
     details of data storage and retrieval for a database system. This
     term is primarily used within the :term:`MySQL` ecosystem due to it
     being the first widely used relational database to have an
     abstraction layer around storage. It is analogous to a Virtual File
     System layer in an Operating System. A VFS layer allows an operating
     system to read and write multiple file systems (e.g. FAT, NTFS, XFS,
     ext3) and a Storage Engine layer allows a database server to access
     tables stored in different engines (e.g. :term:`MyISAM`, InnoDB).
  
   XtraDB

     Percona's improved version of :term:`InnoDB` providing performance,
     features and reliability above what is shipped by Oracle in InnoDB.
  
   LSN

      Each InnoDB page (usually 16kb in size) contains a log sequence number, or
      LSN. The LSN is the system version number for the entire database. Each
      page's LSN shows how recently it was changed.
  
   InnoDB

      Storage engine which provides ACID-compliant transactions and foreign key
      support, among others improvements over :term:`MyISAM`. It is the default
      engine for |MySQL| as of the 5.5 series.
  
   MyISAM

      Previous default storage engine for |MySQL| for versions prior to 5.5. It
      doesn't fully support transactions but in some scenarios may be faster
      than :term:`InnoDB`. Each table is stored on disk in 3 files: :term:`.frm`,i
      :file:`.MYD`, :file:`.MYI`.
  
   GTID

      Global Transaction ID, in *Percona XtraDB Cluster* it consists of
      :term:`UUID` and an ordinal sequence number which denotes the position of
      the change in the sequence.
  
   HAProxy

      `HAProxy <http://haproxy.1wt.eu/>`_ is a free, very fast and reliable
      solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP
      and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites
      crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7
      processing. Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly
      realistic with todays hardware. Its mode of operation makes its
      integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while
      still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the
      net.
  
   IST

      Incremental State Transfer. Functionality which instead of whole state
      snapshot can catch up with the group by receiving the missing writesets,
      but only if the writeset is still in the donor's writeset cache.
  
   SST

      State Snapshot Transfer is the full copy of data from one node
      to another.  It's used when a new node joins the cluster, it has
      to transfer data from an existing node.

      |Percona XtraDB
      Cluster|: uses the :program:`xtrabackup` program for this
      purpose.  :program:`xtrabackup` does not require :command:`READ
      LOCK` for the entire syncing process - only for syncing the
      |MySQL| system tables and writing the information about the
      binlog, galera and replica information (same as the regular
      |Percona XtraBackup| backup).

      The SST method is configured with the :variable:`wsrep_sst_method` variable.
  
      In |pxc| |version|, the |mysql-upgrade| command is now run
      automatically as part of :term:`SST`. You do not have to run it
      manually when upgrading your system from an older version.

   UUID

      Universally Unique IDentifier which uniquely identifies the state and the
      sequence of changes node undergoes. 128-bit UUID is a classic DCE UUID
      Version 1 (based on current time and MAC address). Although in theory this
      UUID could be generated based on the real MAC-address, in the Galera it is
      always (without exception) based on the generated pseudo-random addresses
      ("locally administered" bit in the node address (in the UUID structure) is
      always equal to unity).
  
      Complete structure of the 128-bit UUID field and explanation for its
      generation are as follows:
  
      ===== ====  ======= =====================================================
      From  To    Length  Content
      ===== ====  ======= =====================================================
       0     31    32     Bits 0-31 of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as a
                          count of 100-nanosecond intervals since 00:00:00.00,
                          15 October 1582, encoded as big-endian 32-bit number.
      32     47    16     Bits 32-47 of UTC as a count of 100-nanosecond
                          intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582, encoded
                          as big-endian 16-bit number.
      48     59    12     Bits 48-59 of UTC as a count of 100-nanosecond
                          intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582, encoded
                          as big-endian 16-bit number.
      60     63     4     UUID version number: always equal to 1 (DCE UUID).
      64     69     6     most-significants bits of random number, which
                          generated from the server process PID and Coordinated
                          Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond
                          intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.
      70     71     2     UID variant: always equal to binary 10 (DCE variant).
      72     79     8     8 least-significant bits of  random number, which
                          generated from the server process PID and Coordinated
                          Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond
                          intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582.
      80     80     1     Random bit ("unique node identifier").
      81     81     1     Always equal to the one ("locally administered MAC
                          address").
      82    127    46     Random bits ("unique node identifier"): readed from
                          the :file:`/dev/urandom` or (if :file:`/dev/urandom`
                          is unavailable) generated based on the server process
                          PID, current time and bits of the default "zero node
                          identifier" (entropy data).

   XtraBackup

      *Percona XtraBackup* is an open-source hot backup utility for |MySQL| -
      based servers that doesn't lock your database during the backup.
  
   XtraDB

      *Percona XtraDB* is an enhanced version of the InnoDB storage engine,
      designed to better scale on modern hardware, and including a variety of
      other features useful in high performance environments. It is fully
      backwards compatible, and so can be used as a drop-in replacement for
      standard InnoDB. More information `here
      <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/percona_xtradb.html>`_ .
  
   XtraDB Cluster

      *Percona XtraDB Cluster* is a high availability solution for MySQL.
  
   Percona XtraDB Cluster

      *Percona XtraDB Cluster* (PXC) is a high availability solution for MySQL.
  
   my.cnf

      This file refers to the database server's main configuration file. Most
      Linux distributions place it as :file:`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or
      :file:`/etc/my.cnf`, but the location and name depends on the particular
      installation. Note that this is not the only way of configuring the
      server, some systems does not have one even and rely on the command
      options to start the server and its defaults values.
  
   cluster replication

      Normal replication path for cluster members. Can be encrypted (not by
      default) and unicast or multicast (unicast by default). Runs on tcp port
      4567 by default.
  
   datadir

     The directory in which the database server stores its databases. Most Linux
     distribution use :file:`/var/lib/mysql` by default.
  
   donor node

     The node elected to provide a state transfer (SST or IST).
  
   ibdata

      Default prefix for tablespace files, e.g. :file:`ibdata1` is a 10MB
      autoextendable file that |MySQL| creates for the shared tablespace by
      default.
  
   joiner node

      The node joining the cluster, usually a state transfer target.
  
   node

      A cluster node -- a single mysql instance that is in the cluster.
  
   primary cluster

      A cluster with :term:`quorum`. A non-primary cluster will not allow any
      operations and will give ``Unknown command`` errors on any clients
      attempting to read or write from the database.
  
   quorum

      A majority (> 50%) of nodes. In the event of a network partition, only the
      cluster partition that retains a quorum (if any) will remain Primary by
      default.
  
   split brain

      Split brain occurs when two parts of a computer cluster are disconnected,
      each part believing that the other is no longer running. This problem can
      lead to data inconsistency.
  
   .frm

      For each table, the server will create a file with the :file:`.frm`
      extension containing the table definition (for all storage engines).

   mysql.pxc.internal.session

      This user is used by the SST process to run the SQL commands needed for
      :term:`SST`, such as creating the |pxc-sst-user| and assigning it the role
      |pxc-sst-role|).

      .. admonition:: Difference from previous major version |prev-major-version|

	 The |wsrep-sst-auth| variable is no longer needed and has been removed.

   mysql.pxc.sst.role

      This role has all the privileges needed to run xtrabackup to create a
      backup on the donor node.

   mysql.pxc.sst.user

      This user (set up on the donor node) is assigned the |pxc-sst-role| and
      runs the |xtrabackup| to make backups. The password for this is randomly
      generated for each SST. The password is generated automatically for each
      :term:`SST`.
