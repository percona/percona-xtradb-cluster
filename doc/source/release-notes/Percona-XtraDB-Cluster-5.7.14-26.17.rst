New Features
============

This is a list of the most important features introduced in |PXC| 5.7
compared to version 5.6

* :ref:`pxc-strict-mode` saves your workload
  from experimental and unsupported features.

* Support for monitoring Galera Library instruments
  and other wsrep instruments as part of Performance Schema.

* Support for encrypted tablespaces in Multi-Master Topology,
  which enables |PXC| to wire encrypted tablespace to new booting node.

* Compatibility with ProxySQL, including a quick configuration script.

* Support for monitoring |PXC| nodes using
  `Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management>`_

* More stable and robust operation with MySQL and Percona Server version 5.7.14,
  as well as Galera 3.17 compatibility.
  Includes all upstream bug fixes, improved logging and more.

* Simplified packaging for |PXC| to a single package
  that installs everything it needs, including the Galera library.

* Support for latest XtraBackup with enhanced security checks.

Bug Fixes
=========

PXC-568: Fixed crash when a local transaction (such as ``EXPLAIN`` or ``SHOW``)
is interrupted by a replicated transaction with higher priopiry
(like ``ALTER`` that changes table structure
and can thus affect the result of the local transaction).

PXC-665 and 1608680: Fixed DONOR node getting stuck in ``Joined`` state
after successful SST.

PXC-672: Fixed error message when altering non-existent table
with ``pxc-strict-mode`` enabled.

PXC-673 and 1615089: Fixed path to directory in :file:`percona-xtradb-cluster-shared.conf`.

PXC-676: Fixed setting of ``seqno`` in :file:`grastate.dat` to ``-1``
on clean shutdown.

PXC-680: Fixed failure of asynchronous TOI actions (like ``DROP``)
for non-primary nodes.

BLD-475: Fixed replacing of ``my.cnf`` during upgrade from 5.6 to 5.7.
