Adding Nodes to Cluster
=======================

New :term:`nodes <Node>` that are :ref:`properly configured <configure>`
are provisioned automatically.
When you start a node with the address of at least one other running :term:`node`
in the :variable:`wsrep_cluster_address` variable,
it automatically joins the cluster and synchronizes with it.

.. note:: Any existing data and configuration will be overwritten
   to match the data and configuration of the :term:`DONOR node`.
   Do not join several nodes at the same time
   to avoid overhead due to large amounts of traffic when a new node joins.

By default, |PXC| uses |PXB|_ for *State Snapshot Transfer* (:term:`SST`).
This requires the following:

* Set the :variable:`wsrep_sst_method`` variable to ``xtrabackup-v2`` and
  provide SST user credentials with the :variable:`wsrep_sst_auth`` variable.

  For more information, see :ref:`configure`.

* Create a user for SST on the initial :term:`node`.

  For more information, see :ref:`bootstrap`.

Starting the Second Node
========================

Start the second node using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@pxc2 ~]# /etc/init.d/mysql start

After the server starts, it should receive :term:`SST` automatically.

To check the status of the second node, run the following:

.. code-block:: sql

   mysql@pxc2> show status like 'wsrep%';

   | wsrep_local_state          | 4                                    |

   | wsrep_connected            | ON                                   |
   | ...                        | ...                                  |

   40 rows in set (0.01 sec)

Previous output shows that the new node
has been successfully added to the cluster.
Cluster size is now 2 nodes, it is the primary component,
and it is fully connected and ready to receive write-set replication.

If the state of the second node is ``Synced`` as in the previous example,
then the node received full SST, is synchronized with the cluster,
and you can proceed to add the next node.

.. note:: If the state of the node is ``Joiner``,
   it means that SST hasn't finished.
   Do not add new nodes until all others are in ``Synced`` state.

Starting the Third Node
=======================

To add the third node, start it as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

   [root@pxc3 ~]# /etc/init.d/mysql start

To check the status of the third node, run the following:

.. code-block:: sql

   mysql@pxc3> show status like 'wsrep%';
   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Variable_name              | Value                                |

   | wsrep_local_state_uuid     | c2883338-834d-11e2-0800-03c9c68e41ec |
   | ...                        | ...                                  |
   | wsrep_local_state          | 4                                    |
   | wsrep_local_state_comment  | Synced                               |
   | ...                        | ...                                  |
   | wsrep_cluster_size         | 3                                    |
   | wsrep_cluster_status       | Primary                              |
   | wsrep_connected            | ON                                   |
   | ...                        | ...                                  |
   | wsrep_ready                | ON                                   |
   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   40 rows in set (0.01 sec)

Previous output shows that the new node
has been successfully added to the cluster.
Cluster size is now 3 nodes, it is the primary component,
and it is fully connected and ready to receive write-set replication.

Next Steps
==========

When you add all nodes to the cluster,
you can :ref:`verify replication <verify>`
by running queries and manipulating data on nodes
to see if these changes are synchronized accross the cluster.
