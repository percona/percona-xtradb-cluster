Introduction
============

"Data-at-rest" term refers to all the data stored on disk by a server within
system tablespace, general tablespace, redo-logs, undo-logs, etc. As the
opposite, "data-in-transit" means data transmitted to another node or client.
Data-in-transit can be encrypted using an SSL connection (details are available in
the `encrypt traffic documentation
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/LATEST/security/encrypt-traffic.html>`_)
and
therefore supposed to be safe.

Currently, a data-at-rest encryption is supported in |PXC| for
file-per-table tablespace and temporary files.

InnoDB tablespace encryption
============================

|MySQL| supports tablespace encryption, but only for the file-per-table tablespace.
The user should create a table with a dedicated tablespace, making this
tablespace encrypted by specifying the appropriate option.

|PXC| already supported data-at-rest encryption starting from ``5.7``.
File-per-tablespace encryption is a table/tablespace
specific feature and is enabled on object level through DDL:

.. code-block:: guess

   CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, PRIMARY KEY pk(c1)) ENCRYPTION=’Y’;
   CREATE TABLESPACE foo ADD DATAFILE 'foo.ibd' ENCRYPTION='Y';

DDL statements are replicated in the PXC cluster and creates the encrypted table or
tablespace on all the nodes of the cluster.

This feature requires a keyring plugin to be loaded before it can be used.
Currently, Percona Server (and in turn |PXC|) supports two types of keyring
plugin: ``keyring_file`` and ``keyring_vault``.

Temporary file encryption
=========================

Percona Server 5.7.22 added support for encrypting temporary file storage
enabled using ``encrypt-tmp-files``. This storage or files are local to the
node and has no direct effect on |PXC| replication. |PXC| recommends enabling
it on all the cluster nodes, though the action is not mandatory. The parameter
is the same as in Percona Server:

.. code-block:: text

   [mysqld]
   encrypt-tmp-files=ON

Configuring PXC to use keyring_file plugin
==========================================

keyring_file
------------

Support for the keyring file was added when |PXC| 5.7 achieved General
Availability (GA) status. The following subsection covers some of the essential
procedures of ``keyring_file`` plugin.

The ``keyring_file`` stores an encryption key to a physical file. The location of this
file is specified by ``keyring_file_data`` parameter configured during startup.

Configuration
*************

|PXC| inherits upstream (Percona Server) behavior to configure ``keyring_file``
plugin. The following options are set in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: text

   [mysqld]
   early-plugin-load=keyring_file.so
   keyring_file_data=<PATH>/keyring

A ``SHOW PLUGINS`` statement can be used to check if the plugin has been
successfully loaded.

.. note:: PXC recommends the same configuration on all cluster nodes,
   and all nodes should have the keyring
   configured. A mismatch in the keyring configuration does not allow the JOINER node to
   join the cluster.

If the user has bootstrapped node with keyring enabled, then upcoming cluster nodes
inherit the keyring (the encrypted key) from the DONOR node
(in |PXC| prior to 5.7.22) or generate the keyring (starting from |PXC| 5.7.22).

Usage
*****

Prior to |PXC| :rn:`5.7.22-29.26` DONOR node had to send keyring to JOINER,
because |xtrabackup| backs up encrypted tablespaces as encrypted and for the
JOINER to read these encrypted tablespaces it must have the same
encryption key used for the table's encryption on DONOR. This restriction has
been relaxed in |PXC| 5.7.22 and now |xtrabackup| re-encrypts the data using
transition-key and JOINER re-encrypts it using a newly generated master-key.

A keyring is sent from DONOR to JOINER as part of SST process (prior to |PXC|
5.7.22) or generated on JOINER. SST can be done
using xtrabackup (the recommended way), rsync, or mysqldump. In *xtrabackup*
case, the keyring is sent over explicitly before the data backup/streaming
starts. The other two SST variants behave differently: mysqldump uses logical
backup so it doesn’t need to send keyring, while rsync will sync the keys when
it syncs data directories. 

.. warning:: rsync doesn’t provide a secure channel. This lack of a
   secure channel means a keyring sent
   using rsync SST could be vulnerable to attack. The
   recommended SST way with xtrabackup user can configure a secure channel and the
   keyring is fully secured (in fact, xtrabackup will not allow a user to send
   the keyring if the SST channel is not secured). 

.. warning Percona does not recommend rsync-based SST for data-at-rest
   encryption using keyring.

To maintain data consistency, |PXC| does not allow a combination of nodes
with encryption and nodes without encryption. For
example, a user creates node-1 with encryption (keyring) enabled and node-2
with encryption (keyring) disabled. A table created with
encryption on node-1 fails on node-2, causing data inconsistency.

With |PXC| :rn:`5.7.22-29.26`, a node will fail to start if it fails to load
keyring plugin. 

.. note:: If you do not specify the keyring parameters, the node does not know
   that it must load keyring. A JOINER node may start but eventually
   shutdown when DML-level inconsistency with encrypted tablespace is
   detected.

If a node doesn’t have an encrypted tablespace, the keyring is not generated and
the keyring file is empty. The keyring is generated only when node starts
using an encrypted tablespace.

A user can rotate the key when needed.
``ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`` statement is not replicated on
cluster, so it is a local operation for the selected node.

Starting from |PXC| 5.7.22 JOINER generates its keyring. In |PXC| before
5.7.22 when JOINER joined the cluster, its keyring was the same as DONOR’s keyring.
The user could rotate the key if different keys for each node is part
of the user’s requirements (internal rules). Using different keys for each
node is not necessary from the technical side, since all cluster nodes can
continue operating with the same MASTER-key.

Compatibility
*************

Keyring (or, more generally, the |PXC| SST process) is backward compatible, as
in higher version JOINER can join from lower version DONOR, but not vice-versa.
More details are covered in the `Upgrade and compatibility issues`_ section.

.. note:: Since |PXC| 5.6 does not have encrypted tablespaces, no major
   upgrade scenario for data-at-rest encryption is possible.

Configuring PXC to use keyring_vault plugin
===========================================

keyring_vault
-------------

The ``keyring_vault`` plugin is supported starting from PXC 5.7.22. This plugin
allows storing the master-key in vault-server (vs. local file as in the
``keyring_file``).

.. warning:: rsync does not support ``keyring_vault``, and SST on a joiner is
   aborted if rsync is used on the node with ``keyring_vault`` configured.

Configuration
*************

Configuration options are the same as
`upstream
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html#keyring-vault-plugin>`_.
The ``my.cnf`` configuration file should contain
the following options:

.. code-block:: text

   [mysqld]
   early-plugin-load="keyring_vault=keyring_vault.so"
   keyring_vault_config="<PATH>/keyring_vault_n1.conf"

Also ``keyring_vault_n1.conf`` file contents should be :

.. code-block:: text

   vault_url = http://127.0.0.1:8200
   secret_mount_point = secret1
   token = e0345eb4-35dd-3ddd-3b1e-e42bb9f2525d
   vault_ca = /data/keyring_vault_confs/vault_ca.crt

The detailed description of these options can be found in the `upstream documentation <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.7/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html#keyring-vault-plugin>`_.

Vault-server is an external server, so make sure PXC node can reach the
server.

.. note:: |PXC| recommends using the same keyring_plugin on all
   cluster nodes. Mixing keyring plugins is recommended only while transitioning from
   ``keyring_file`` -> ``keyring_vault`` or vice-versa.

All nodes do not need to refer to same vault server. Whatever
vault server is used, it should be accessible from the respective node. Also
there is no restriction for all nodes to use the same mount point.

If the node is not able to reach/connect to the vault server, an error is notified
during the server boot, and node refuses to start:

.. code-block:: text

   2018-05-29T03:54:33.859613Z 0 [Warning] Plugin keyring_vault reported:
   'There is no vault_ca specified in keyring_vault's configuration file.
   Please make sure that Vault's CA certificate is trusted by the machine
   from which you intend to connect to Vault.'
   2018-05-29T03:54:33.977145Z 0 [ERROR] Plugin keyring_vault reported:
   'CURL returned this error code: 7 with error message : Failed to connect
   to 127.0.0.1 port 8200: Connection refused'

If some nodes of the cluster are unable to connect to vault-server, this
relates only to these specific nodes: e.g., if node-1 can connect, and
node-2 cannot connect, only node-2 refuses to start. Also, if the server has
pre-existing encrypted object and on reboot, the server fails to connect to
vault-server, the object is not accessible.

In case when vault-server is accessible but authentication credential is incorrect,
the consequences are the same, and the corresponding error looks like the following:

.. code-block:: text

   2018-05-29T03:58:54.461911Z 0 [Warning] Plugin keyring_vault reported:
   'There is no vault_ca specified in keyring_vault's configuration file.
   Please make sure that Vault's CA certificate is trusted by the machine
   from which you intend to connect to Vault.'
   2018-05-29T03:58:54.577477Z 0 [ERROR] Plugin keyring_vault reported:
   'Could not retrieve list of keys from Vault. Vault has returned the
   following error(s): ["permission denied"]'

In case of accessible vault-server with the wrong mount point, there is no
error during server boot, but the node still refuses to start:

.. code-block:: text

   mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, PRIMARY KEY pk(c1)) ENCRYPTION='Y';
   ERROR 3185 (HY000): Can't find master key from keyring, please check keyring plugin is loaded.

   2018-05-29T04:01:33.774786Z 5 [ERROR] Plugin keyring_vault reported:
   'Could not flush keys to keyring'

Mixing keyring plugins
=========================

With |xtrabackup| introducing transition-key logic, it is now possible to
mix and match keyring plugins. For example, the user has node-1 configured to use
``keyring_file`` plugin and node-2 configured to use ``keyring_vault``.

.. note:: Percona recommends the same configuration for all the nodes of the
   cluster. A mix and match (in keyring plugins) is recommended only during
   transition from one type of keying to another.

Upgrade and compatibility issues
--------------------------------


|PXC| server before ``5.7.22`` only supported ``keyring_file`` and the
dependent |xtrabackup| did not have the concept of transition-key. This makes the
mix and match of old |PXC| server (pre-5.7.21) using ``keyring_file`` with new
|PXC| server (post-5.7.22) using ``keyring_vault`` not possible. A user should
first upgrade |PXC| server to version 5.7.22 or newer using ``keyring_file``
plugin and then let it act as DONOR to a new booting ``keyring_vault`` running
JOINER.

If all the nodes use |PXC| 5.7.22, then the user can freely
configure some nodes to use ``keyring_file`` and other to use
``keyring_vault``, but this setup is not recommended and should be used
during transitioning to vault only.

If all the nodes are using |PXC| 5.7.21 and the user would like to use
``keyring_vault`` plugin, all the nodes should be upgraded to use |PXC| 5.7.22
(that is where vault plugin support was introduced in PXC) or newer. Once all nodes are
configured to use |PXC| 5.7.22, users can switch one node to use
``vault-plugin``.

.. note:: |MySQL| 5.7.21 supports `migration between keystores
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/5.7/en/keyring-key-migration.html>`_.
Migration requires a restart.
=======
.. note:: |MySQL| 5.7.21 has support for `migration between keystores <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/5.7/en/keyring-key-migration.html>`_. Although a restart is required.

|PXC| currently supports data-at-rest encryption for file-per-tablespace and temporary files.

InnoDB tablespace encryption
============================

|MySQL| supports tablespace encryption, but only for the file-per-table tablespace.
The user should create a table with a dedicated tablespace, making this
tablespace encrypted by specifying the appropriate option.

Percona Server starting from :rn:`5.7.21-20` is extending support for
encrypting `other tablespaces <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`_ too.

|PXC| already supported data-at-rest encryption starting from ``5.7``.
File-per-tablespace and general tablespace encryption are table/tablespace
specific features and are enabled on the object level through DDL:

.. code-block:: guess

   CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, PRIMARY KEY pk(c1)) ENCRYPTION=’Y’;
   CREATE TABLESPACE foo ADD DATAFILE 'foo.ibd' ENCRYPTION='Y';

DDL statements are replicated in PXC cluster, thus creating an encrypted table or
tablespace on all the nodes of the cluster.

Temporary file encryption

Migrating Keys Between Keyring Keystores
========================================

|PXC| supports key migration between keystores. The migration can be performed
offline or online.

Offline Migration
-----------------

In offline migration, the node to migrate is shutdown and the migration server
takes care of migrating keys for the said server to a new keystore.

Following example illustrates this scenario:

1. Three |PXC| nodes n1, n2, n3 - all using ``keyring_file``, 
   and n2 should be migrated to use ``keyring_vault``
2. The user shuts down n2 node.
3. The user starts the Migration Server (``mysqld`` with a special option).
4. The Migration Server copies keys from n2 keyring file and adds them to the vault
   server.
5. The user starts n2 node with the vault parameter, and keys should be available.

Here is how the migration server output should look like:

.. code-block:: text

   /dev/shm/pxc57/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/dev/shm/pxc57/copy_mig.cnf \
   --keyring-migration-source=keyring_file.so \
   --keyring_file_data=/dev/shm/pxc57/node2/keyring \
   --keyring-migration-destination=keyring_vault.so \

The destination keystore recieves additional migrated keys
(pre-existing keys in destination keystore are not touched or removed) on successful
migration. The source
keystore continues to retain the keys as migration performs copy operation and
not move operation.

If the migration fails, then the destination keystore is left untouched.

Online Migration
----------------

In online migration, node to migrate is kept running, and the migration server takes
care of migrating keys for the said server to a new keystore by connecting to
the node.

The following example illustrates this scenario:

1. Three |PXC| nodes n1, n2, n3 - all using ``keyring_file``, 
   and n3 should be migrated to use ``keyring_vault``
2. User starts the Migration Server (``mysqld`` with a special option).
3. Migration Server copies keys from the n3 keyring file and adds them to the vault
   server.
4. The user restarts n3 node with the vault parameter, and keys should be available.

Here is how the migration server output should look like:

.. code-block:: text

   /dev/shm/pxc57/bin/mysqld --defaults-file=/dev/shm/pxc57/copy_mig.cnf \
   --keyring-migration-source=keyring_vault.so \

   --keyring-migration-destination=keyring_file.so \
   --keyring_file_data=/dev/shm/pxc57/node3/keyring \
   --keyring-migration-host=localhost \
   --keyring-migration-user=root \

On a successful migration, the destination keystore has the additional migrated keys
(the pre-existing keys in the destination keystore are not touched or removed).
The source
keystore continues to retain the keys as the migration performs copy operation and
not move operation. 

If the migration fails, then the destination keystore is left untouched.

Migration server options
------------------------

* ``--keyring-migration-source``: The source keyring plugin that manages the
  keys to be migrated.

* ``--keyring-migration-destination``: The destination keyring plugin to which
  the migrated keys are to be copied
  
  .. note:: For offline migration, no additional key migration options are
     needed. 

* ``--keyring-migration-host``: The host where the running server is located.
  This host is always the local host.

* ``--keyring-migration-user``, ``--keyring-migration-password``: The username
  and password for the account used to connect to the running server.

* ``--keyring-migration-port``: Used for TCP/IP connections, the running server's port  number used to connect.

* ``--keyring-migration-socket``: Used for Unix socket file or Windows named pipe
  connections, the running server socket or named pipe used to connect.

Prerequisite for migration:

Make sure to pass required keyring options and other configuration parameters
for the two keyring plugins. For example, if ``keyring_file`` is one of the
plugins, you must set the :variable:`keyring_file_data` system variable if the
keyring data file location is not the default location.

Other non-keyring options may be required as well. One way to specify these
options is by using ``--defaults-file`` to name an option file that contains
the required options.
