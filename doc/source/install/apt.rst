====================================
Installing |PXC| on Debian or Ubuntu
====================================

Percona provides :file:`.deb` packages for 64-bit versions
of the following distributions:

* Debian 9 (stretch)
* Debian 10 (buster)
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)

.. note:: |PXC| should work on other DEB-based distributions,
   but it is tested only on platforms listed above.

The packages are available in the official Percona software repository
and on the `download page
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-80/LATEST/>`_.
It is recommended to install |PXC| from the official repository
using :command:`apt`.

Prerequisites
=============

- You need to have root access on the node where you will be installing |PXC|
  (either logged in as a user with root privileges or be able to run commands
  with :command:`sudo`).

- Make sure that the following ports are not blocked by firewall
  or used by other software. |PXC| requires them for communication.

   * 3306
   * 4444
   * 4567
   * 4568

- If you previously had MySQL installed on the server, there might be an
  `AppArmor <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor>`_ profile which will
  prevent |PXC| nodes from communicating with each other.  The best solution is
  to remove the ``apparmor`` package entirely:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get remove apparmor

  If you need to have AppArmor enabled due to security policies or for other
  reasons, it is possible to disable or extend the MySQL profile.

Installing from Repository
==========================

1. Configure Percona repositories as described in
   `Percona Software Repositories Documentation
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/index.html>`_.

#. Install the |PXC| server package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-80

   .. note:: Alternatively, you can install
      the ``percona-xtradb-cluster-full-80`` meta package,
      which contains the following additional packages:

      * ``libperconaserverclient21-dev``
      * ``libperconaserverclient21``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-client``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-common``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-dbg`
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-full``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-debug``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-server-debug``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-server``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-source``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-test``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster``


   During the installation, you are requested to provide a password
   for the ``root`` user on the database node.

Next Steps
==========

After you install |PXC| and stop the ``mysql`` service,
configure the node according to the procedure described in :ref:`configure`.
