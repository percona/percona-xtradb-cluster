====================================
Installing |PXC| on Debian or Ubuntu
====================================

Specific information on the supported platforms, products, and versions is described in `Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle <https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-platform-lifecycle#mysql>`_.

The packages are available in the official Percona software repository
and on the `download page
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-57/LATEST/>`_.
It is recommended to install |PXC| from the official repository
using :command:`apt`.

Prerequisites
=============

You need to have root access on the node where you will be installing
|PXC| (either logged in as a user with root privileges or be able
to run commands with :command:`sudo`).

Make sure that the following ports are not blocked by firewall or used
by other software. |PXC| requires them for communication.

* 3306
* 4444
* 4567
* 4568

.. note::

    To view the listening ports, enter the following command:
    
    .. code-block:: bash
    
        $ sudo ss -tunlp
        
.. rubric:: If |MySQL| Is Installed

If you previously had MySQL installed on the server, there might be an
`AppArmor <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor>`_ profile
which will prevent |PXC| nodes from communicating with each other.
The best solution is to remove the ``apparmor`` package entirely:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   $ sudo apt-get remove apparmor

If you need to have AppArmor enabled due to security policies or for
other reasons, it is possible to disable or extend the MySQL profile.

.. rubric:: Dependencies on Ubuntu

When installing on a Ubuntu system, make sure that the ``universe``
repository is enabled to satisfy all essential dependencies.

.. seealso::

   `Ubuntu Documentation: Repositories <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu>`_

Installing from Repository
==========================

1. Configure Percona repositories as described in
   `Percona Software Repositories Documentation
   <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-repo-config/index.html>`_.

#. Install the |PXC| server package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install percona-xtradb-cluster-57

   .. note:: Alternatively, you can install
      the ``percona-xtradb-cluster-full-57`` meta package,
      which contains the following additional packages:

      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-test-5.7``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-5.7-dbg``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-3.x``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-galera-3.x-dbg``
      * ``percona-xtradb-cluster-garbd-3.x-dbg``
      * ``libmysqlclient18``

   During installation, you will be prompted to provide a password
   for the ``root`` user on the database node.

#. Stop the ``mysql`` service:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mysql stop

   .. note:: All Debian-based distributions start services
      as soon as the corresponding package is installed.
      Before starting a |PXC| node, it needs to be properly configured.
      For more information, see :ref:`configure`.

Next Steps
==========

After you install |PXC| and stop the ``mysql`` service,
configure the node according to the procedure described in :ref:`configure`.
