PXC Strict Mode
===============

PXC Strict Mode is designed to avoid the use of
experimental and unsupported features in |PXC|.
It performs a number of validations at startup and during runtime.

Depending on the actual mode you select,
upon encountering a failed validation,
the server will either throw an error
(halting startup or denying the operation),
or log a warning and continue running as normal.
The following modes are available:

* ``DISABLED``: Do not perform strict mode validations
  and run as normal.

* ``PERMISSIVE``: If a vaidation fails, log a warning and continue running
  as normal.

* ``ENFORCING``: If a validation fails during startup,
  halt the server and throw an error.
  If a validation fails during runtime,
  deny the operation and throw an error.

* ``MASTER``: The same as ``ENFORCING`` except that the validation of
  :ref:`explicit table locking <explicit-table-locking>` is not performed.
  This mode can be used with clusters
  in which write operations are isolated to a single node.

By default, PXC Strict Mode is set to ``ENFORCING``,
except if the node is acting as a standalone server
or the node is bootstrapping, then PXC Strict Mode defaults to ``DISABLED``.

It is recommended to keep PXC Strict Mode set to ``ENFORCING``,
because in this case whenever |PXC| encounters an experimental feature
or an unsupported operation, the server will deny it.
This will force you to re-evaluate your |PXC| configuration
without risking the consistency of your data.

If you are planning to set PXC Strict Mode to anything else than ``ENFORCING``,
you should be aware of the limitations and effects
that this may have on data integrity.
For more information, see :ref:`validations`.

To set the mode,
use the :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` variable in the configuration file
or the ``--pxc-strict-mode`` option during ``mysqld`` startup.

.. note::

   It is better to start the server with the necessary mode
   (the default ``ENFORCING`` is highly recommended).
   However, you can dynamically change it during runtime.
   For example, to set PXC Strict Mode to ``PERMISSIVE``,
   run the following command::

      mysql> SET GLOBAL pxc_strict_mode=PERMISSIVE;

.. note::

   To further ensure data consistency,
   it is important to have all nodes in the cluster
   running with the same configuration,
   including the value of ``pxc_strict_mode`` variable.

.. _validations:

Validations
================================================================================

PXC Strict Mode validations are designed to ensure optimal operation
for common cluster setups that do not require experimental features
and do not rely on operations not supported by |PXC|.

.. warning:: If an unsupported operation is performed on a node
   with ``pxc_strict_mode`` set to ``DISABLED`` or ``PERMISSIVE``,
   it will not be validated on nodes where it is replicated to,
   even if the destination node has ``pxc_strict_mode`` set to ``ENFORCING``.

This section describes the purpose and consequences of each validation.

Group replication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. TODO:

   Provide steps for migrating from group replication

   describing why (e.g. it is a completely different
   clustering product, and we only support migration from/to, not
   actively running them together), and how (disabled - allowed,
   permission - warnings, enforcing/master - can't be turned on)

*Group replication* is a feature of |mysql| that `provides distributed state
machine replication with strong coordination between servers
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication.html>`_. It is
implemented as a plugin which, if activated, may conflict with |pxc|. Group
replication cannot be activated to run alongside |pxc|. However, you can migrate
to |pxc| from the environment that uses group replication.

For the strict mode to work correctly, make sure that the group replication
plugin is *not active*. In fact, if :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` is set to
`ENFORCING` or `MASTER`, the server will stop with an error:

.. admonition:: Error message with :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` set to `ENFORCING` or `MASTER`

   .. code-block:: text

      Group replication cannot be used with |pxc| in strict mode.

If :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` is set to ``DISABLED`` you can use group
replication at your own risk. Setting :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` to
``PERMISSIVE`` will result in a warning.

.. admonition:: Warning message with :variable:`pxc_strict_mode` set to `PERMISSIVE`

   .. code-block:: text

      Using group replication with |pxc| is only supported for migration. Please
      make sure that group replication is turned off once all data is migrated to
      |pxc|.

   

.. _storage-engine:

Storage engine
--------------

|PXC| currently supports replication only for tables
that use a transactional storage engine (XtraDB or InnoDB).
To ensure data consistency,
the following statements should not be allowed for tables
that use a non-transactional storage engine (MyISAM, MEMORY, CSV, etc.):

* Data manipulation statements that perform writing to table
  (for example, ``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, etc.)

* The following administrative statements:
  ``CHECK``, ``OPTIMIZE``, ``REPAIR``, and ``ANALYZE``

* ``TRUNCATE TABLE`` and ``ALTER TABLE``

Depending on the selected mode, the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, no validation is perfromed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted,
 but a warning is logged when an undesirable operation
 is performed on an unsupported table.

``ENFORCING`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, any undesirable operation performed on an unsupported table
 is denied and an error is logged.

.. note:: Unsupported tables can be converted to use a supported storage engine.

MyISAM replication
------------------

|PXC| provides experimental support for replication of tables
that use the MyISAM storage engine.
Due to the non-transactional nature of MyISAM,
it is not likely to ever be fully supported in |PXC|.

MyISAM replication is controlled
using the :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` variable,
which is set to ``OFF`` by default.
Due to its unreliability, MyISAM replication should not be enabled
if you want to ensure data consistency.

Depending on the selected mode, the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, you can set :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` to any value.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, if :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` is set to ``ON``,
 a warning is logged and startup continues.

 At runtime, it is permitted to change :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam`
 to any value, but if you set it to ``ON``, a warning is logged.

``ENFORCING`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, if :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` is set to ``ON``,
 an error is logged and startup is aborted.

 At runtime, any attempt to change :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam`
 to ``ON`` fails and an error is logged.

.. note:: The :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` variable controls
   *replication* for MyISAM tables,
   and this validation only checks whether it is allowed.
   Undesirable operations for MyISAM tables
   are restricted using the :ref:`storage-engine` validation.

Binary log format
-----------------

|PXC| supports only the default row-based binary logging format.  In
|version|, setting the |binlog_format|_ variable to anything but
``ROW`` at startup or runtime is not allowed regardless of the value of the
:variable:`pxc_strict_mode` variable.

.. |binlog_format| replace:: ``binlog_format``
.. _binlog_format: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format

Tables without primary keys
---------------------------

|PXC| cannot properly propagate certain write operations
to tables that do not have primary keys defined.
Undesirable operations include data manipulation statements
that perform writing to table (especially ``DELETE``).

Depending on the selected mode, the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, no validation is perfromed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted,
 but a warning is logged when an undesirable operation
 is performed on a table without an explicit primary key defined.

``ENFORCING`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, any undesirable operation
 performed on a table without an explicit primary key
 is denied and an error is logged.

Log output
----------

|PXC| does not support tables in the MySQL database
as the destination for log output.
By default, log entries are written to file.
This validation checks the value of the |log_output|_ variable.

Depending on the selected mode, the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, you can set ``log_output`` to any value.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, if ``log_output`` is set only to ``TABLE``,
 a warning is logged and startup continues.

 At runtime, it is permitted to change ``log_output``
 to any value, but if you set it only to ``TABLE``,
 a warning is logged.

``ENFORCING`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, if ``log_output`` is set only to ``TABLE``,
 an error is logged and startup is aborted.

 At runtime, any attempt to change ``log_output`` only to ``TABLE`` fails
 and an error is logged.

.. |log_output| replace:: ``log_output``
.. _log_output: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_log_output

.. _explicit-table-locking:

Explicit table locking
----------------------

|PXC| has only experimental support for explicit table locking operations,
The following undesirable operations lead to explicit table locking
and are covered by this validation:

* ``LOCK TABLES``
* ``GET_LOCK()`` and ``RELEASE_LOCK()``
* ``FLUSH TABLES <tables> WITH READ LOCK``
* Setting the ``SERIALIZABLE`` transaction level

Depending on the selected mode, the following happens:

``DISABLED`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted,
 but a warning is logged when an undesirable operation is performed.

``ENFORCING``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, any undesirable operation is denied and an error is logged.

Auto-increment lock mode
------------------------

The lock mode for generating auto-increment values must be *interleaved*
to ensure that each node generates a unique (but non-sequential) identifier.

This validation checks the value of the |innodb_autoinc_lock_mode|_ variable.
By default, the variable is set to ``1`` (*consecutive* lock mode),
but it should be set to ``2`` (*interleaved* lock mode).

Depending on the strict mode selected,
the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, if ``innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`` is not set to ``2``,
 a warning is logged and startup continues.

``ENFORCING`` or ``MASTER``

 At startup, if ``innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`` is not set to ``2``,
 an error is logged and startup is aborted.

.. note:: This validation is not performed during runtime,
   because the ``innodb_autoinc_lock_mode`` variable
   cannot be set dynamically.

.. |innodb_autoinc_lock_mode| replace:: ``innodb_autoinc_lock_mode``
.. _innodb_autoinc_lock_mode: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_autoinc_lock_mode

Combining schema and data changes in a single statement
-------------------------------------------------------

With strict mode set to ``ENFORCING``, |PXC| does not support :abbr:`CTAS
(CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT)` statements, because they combine both schema and
data changes. Note that tables in the SELECT clause should be present on all
replication nodes.

With strict mode set to ``PERMISSIVE`` or ``DISABLED``, |ctas| statements are
replicated using the :abbr:`TOI (Total Order Isolation)` method to ensure
consistency. In |PXC| 5.7, |ctas| statements were replicated using DML
write-sets when strict mode was set to ``PERMISSIVE`` or ``DISABLED``.

.. important::
   
   MyISAM tables are created and loaded even if
   :variable:`wsrep_replicate_myisam` equals to 1.  |PXC| does not recommend
   using the |MyISAM| storage engine. The support for |MyISAM| is experimental
   and may be removed in a future release.

.. seealso::

   |MySQL| Bug System: XID inconsistency on master-slave with CTAS
      https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=93948   

Depending on the strict mode selected, the following happens:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Mode
     - Behavior
   * - DISABLED
     - At startup, no validation is performed. At runtime, all operations are
       permitted.
   * - PERMISSIVE
     - At startup, no validation is perfromed. At runtime, all operations are
       permitted, but a warning is logged when a |ctas| operation is performed.
   * - ENFORCING
     - At startup, no validation is performed. At runtime, any CTAS operation is
       denied and an error is logged.

.. important::

   Although |ctas| operations for temporary tables are permitted even in
   ``STRICT`` mode, temporary tables should not be used as *source* tables in
   |ctas| operations due to the fact that temporary tables are not present on
   all nodes.

   If ``node-1`` has a temporary and a non-temporary table with the same name,
   |ctas| on ``node-1`` will use temporary and |ctas| on ``node-2`` will use the
   non-temporary table resulting in a data level inconsistency.

.. worklog: 1h 2/21/2019

Discarding and Importing Tablespaces
------------------------------------

``DISCARD TABLESPACE`` and ``IMPORT TABLESPACE``
are not replicated using TOI.
This can lead to data inconsistency if executed on only one node.

Depending on the strict mode selected,
the following happens:

``DISABLED``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted.

``PERMISSIVE``

 At startup, no validation is perfromed.

 At runtime, all operations are permitted,
 but a warning is logged when you discard or import a tablespace.

``ENFORCING``

 At startup, no validation is performed.

 At runtime, discarding or importing a tablespace is denied
 and an error is logged.
