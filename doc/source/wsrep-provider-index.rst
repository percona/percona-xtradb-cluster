===========================================
Index of :variable:`wsrep_provider` options
===========================================

The following variables can be set and checked in the
:variable:`wsrep_provider_options` variable. The value of the variable can be
changed in the |MySQL| configuration file, :file:`my.cnf`, or by setting the
variable value in the |MySQL| client.

To change the value in :file:`my.cnf`, the following syntax should be used: ::

  wsrep_provider_options="variable1=value1;[variable2=value2]"

For example to set the size of the Galera buffer storage to 512 MB, specify the
following in :file:`my.cnf`: ::

  wsrep_provider_options="gcache.size=512M"

Dynamic variables can be changed from the |MySQL| client using the ``SET
GLOBAL`` command. For example, to change the value of the
:variable:`pc.ignore_sb`, use the following command:

.. code-block:: mysql

  mysql> SET GLOBAL wsrep_provider_options="pc.ignore_sb=true";

more data in it. This variable makes it possible to use :term:`IST
(Incremental State Transfer) <IST>` when the node rejoins instead of
:term:`SST (State Snapshot Transfer) <SST>`.

Set this variable on an existing node of the cluster (that will
continue to be part of the cluster and can act as a potential
:term:`donor node`). This node continues to retain the write-sets and
allows restarting the node to rejoin by using :term:`IST`.

The :variable:`gcache.freeze_purge_at_seqno` variable takes three values:

-1 (default)
   No freezing of gcache, the purge operates as normal.
A valid seqno in gcache
   The freeze purge of write-sets may not be smaller than the selected seqno.
   The best way to select an optimal value is to use the value of the
   variable :variable:`wsrep_last_applied` from the node that you plan to shut down.
*now*
   The freeze purge of write-sets is no less than the smallest seqno currently
   in gcache. Using this value results in freezing the gcache-purge instantly.
   Use this value if selecting a valid seqno in gcache is difficult.
   
.. variable:: gcache.keep_pages_count

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Local, Global
   :dyn: Yes
   :default: 0

This variable is used to limit the number of overflow pages
rather than the total memory occupied by all overflow pages.
Whenever ``gcache.keep_pages_count`` is set to a non-zero value,
excess overflow pages will be deleted
(starting from the oldest to the newest).

Whenever either the ``gcache.keep_pages_count``
or the :variable:`gcache.keep_pages_size` variable
is updated at runtime to a non-zero value,
cleanup is called on excess overflow pages to delete them.

.. variable:: gcache.keep_pages_size

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Local, Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: 0


This variable is used to limit the total size of overflow pages
rather than the count of all overflow pages.
Whenever ``gcache.keep_pages_size`` is set to a non-zero value,
excess overflow pages will be deleted
(starting from the oldest to the newest)
until the total size is below the specified value.

Whenever either the :variable:`gcache.keep_pages_count`
or the ``gcache.keep_pages_size`` variable
is updated at runtime to a non-zero value,
cleanup is called on excess overflow pages to delete them.

.. variable:: gcache.mem_size

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: 0

This variable specifies after how many writesets the debug statistics about SST
flow control will be posted.

.. variable:: gcs.fc_factor

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: Yes
   :default: 100

This variable is used for replication flow control. Replication is paused when
the replica queue exceeds this limit. In the default operation mode, flow control
limit is dynamically recalculated based on the amount of nodes in the
cluster, but this recalculation can be turned off with use of the
:variable:`gcs.fc_master_slave` variable to make manual setting of the :variable:`gcs.fc_limit` having an effect  (e.g. for configurations
when writing is done to a single node in |PXC|).

.. variable:: gcs.fc_master_slave

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: NO

This variable is used to specify if there is only one source node in the

or less if other nodes are discovered.

.. variable:: pc.checksum

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: true

This variable controls whether replicated messages should be checksummed or
not.

.. variable::  pc.ignore_quorum

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: Yes
   :default: false

When this variable is set to ``TRUE``, the node will completely ignore quorum
calculations. This should be used with extreme caution even in source-replica
setups, because replicas won't automatically reconnect to source in this case.

.. variable::  pc.ignore_sb

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: Yes
   :default: false

When this variable is set to ``TRUE``, the node will process updates even in
the case of a split brain. This should be used with extreme caution in
multi-source setup, but should simplify things in source-replica cluster
(especially if only 2 nodes are used).

.. variable::  pc.linger

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: PT20S

This variable specifies the period for which the PC protocol waits for EVS
termination.

older ones in case of conflicting primaries.

.. variable::  pc.recovery

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: true

When this variable is set to ``true``, the node stores the Primary Component
state to disk. The Primary Component can then recover automatically when all
nodes that were part of the last saved state re-establish communication with
each other. This feature allows automatic recovery from full cluster crashes,
such as in the case of a data center power outage. A subsequent graceful full
cluster restart will require explicit bootstrapping for a new Primary
Component.

.. variable::  pc.version

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: 0

This status variable is used to check which PC protocol version is used.

.. variable::  pc.wait_prim

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: true

When set to ``TRUE``, the node waits for a primary component for the period of
time specified in :variable:`pc.wait_prim_timeout`. This is useful to bring up
a non-primary component and make it primary with :variable:`pc.bootstrap`.

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: No
   :default: PT30S
