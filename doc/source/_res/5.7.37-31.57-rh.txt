Release Highlights
=================================================

The following lists a number of the notable updates and fixes for MySQL 5.7.37, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:

* The performance on debug builds has been improved by optimizing the `buf_validate()` function in the *InnoDB* sources.
* Fix for when a query using an index that differs from the primary key of the partitioned table results in excessive CPU load.
* Enabling ``PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH`` SQL mode on a replica server added trailing spaces to a replication channel's name in the replication metadata repository tables. Attempts to identify the channel using the padded name caused errors. The SQL mode is disabled when reading from those tables.
