TODO: Why /bin/bash for some files and /bin/sh for others (this is also the case in native packaging, so might be a reason)
TODO: Related to above: Should be POSIX compliant
TODO: Maybe refactor CMakeLists.txt to remove redundancy
TODO: Clean up install exception list so --list-missing can be changed to --fail-missing

###  WSREP stuff
TODO: Find a more efficient way to configure just "packaging/deb-in/"
TODO: Can we unite systemd files (service definition, pre- and post-scriptlets, maybe more) across platforms?
      In RedHat etc, we have "scripts/systemd/mysqld.service.in" which is working.
      Can we use that to replace "packaging/deb-in/mysql-packagesource-server-SERIES.mysql.service.in" ?
TODO: Check whether it was safe to drop "debian/additions/debian-start*", recover from old sources if not.
TODO: Check everything, especially the pre/post-install/rm scripts,
      and decide whether to follow Debian or Oracle or to create a mix.
TODO: Clean "packaging/deb-in/CMakeLists.txt" for systemd, SysV init, Upstart, and the mix (Debian!).
TODO: Introduce "WITH_SYSV" as a build option, so that we can build packages with both SysV and Systemd
      startup support, as fits Debian (which delivers both).
TODO: Decide about Upstart, either implement support for it or remove the references.
TODO; Check package naming on Debian/Ubuntu:
      We now have platform as part of version in the file name (separator '~')
      because a dash '-' would start a revision which Debian tools don't affect in a "native" package.

###  Other stuff
Package cut: Comments in RPM spec files say "lz4_decompress" and "zlib_decompress" were added to client RPMs.
      That's wrong, they are in the server RPMs. Similar for DEB. They are meant for "mysqlpump" result files
      (if compressed), and that tool is in the client packages (both RPM and DEB).
      Also, placement differs: RPMs have them in "/usr/bin/", DEBs in "/usr/lib/mysql/" and a patch for MTR
      so that they will be found.
      Proposal 1: Make comments come true, move them into client packages.
      Proposal 2: Put them in "/usr/bin/", delete the patch.
