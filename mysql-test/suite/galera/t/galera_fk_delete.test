# This is the main part of the test.
#
# Here we try delete rows from both the tables. If foreign key dependencies
# are not included in the writesets, then the below DELETE statements would
# allow parent table DELETE to be executed in parallel with the child table
# DELETE when wsrep-slave-threads > 1, thus making the wsrep applier thread
# to error out with HA_ERR_ROW_IS_REFERENCED when it tries to delete the
# parent row while some of the rows in the child table are still referring
# to the same row.
#
# If foreign key dependencies are written to the writesets, then
# depends_seqno of the parent table delete would point to the global seqno
# of the child table delete and it ensures that we don't parallelize these
# statements on other nodes.
