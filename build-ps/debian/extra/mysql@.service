# Systemd service file for Percona XtraDB Cluster


# This service file allows for instance specifier %i
# to pass an Environment file
# Example: systemctl start mysql@bootstrap.service
# will check for EnvironmentFile named /etc/default/mysql.bootstrap

# The environment file can  have any key=value
# variables separated by newlines.

# But, EXTRA_ARGS must be there - empty/set
# EXTRA_ARGS=" --wsrep-new-cluster" for bootstrapping
# /etc/default/mysql.bootstrap is provided for convenience
# and as a template.


# Note, this is NOT a replacement for my.cnf
# This file is just to pass environment variables and/or
# EXTRA_ARGS to mysqld_safe.
#
# For bootstrapping, you may not want to enable mysql@bootstrap
# but start it directly since you don't want
# a bootstrapped mysqld coming up on reboot.
#
# But, if you want to pass CUSTOM flags, create a file called
# /etc/default/mysql.custom and then
# add EXTRA_ARGS=" --wsrep-debug " etc. to it along
# with any environment variables you may want to pass.
# After that you can either enable it or start it as
# systemctl start mysql@custom.service.
