# dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile on /etc/mysql/my.cnf. As a one off, if
# my.cnf.dpkg-bak exists after this stage then we rename it to
# /etc/mysql/my.cnf.migrated, add an explanatory note to the top and add it is
# a high priority alternative so it gets used in favour of any other my.cnf
# shipped by variants. The /etc/mysql/my.cnf.migrated file will not be owned by
# any package (just like /etc/mysql/my.cnf.dpkg-bak would have been) but we
# rename it since it will be in active use, the user may not expect a .dpkg-bak
# file to be in use and we do not want to surprise the user.
